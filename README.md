# Classification contest using the adult dataset

The dataset can be found at [this link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult). The files `adult.data` and `adult.test` are located in the folder `dataset` as .csv files. The only change I made in the files was to remove the first line of the `adult.test` file.

The solution can be accessed by `solution.ipynb` and `solution.py` files. In the file `solution.py` the whole process is done but only the result is displayed.
